# Welcome!

I am starblaseter. This site is a tool I will to use to share information I have learned, resources for others, projects I have done and a personal portfolio. 
I love all things technology. The subjects I plan to post on this site are: space, cyber security, programming--from high to low level, science and anything else of interest to me. 


site is a work in progress so be aware of this
